To install this on your system, first you need the following dependencies:

```bash
yay -S nerd-fonts-ubuntu-mono
```

I always use that font for icons.
You will also need my custom
**[dwmblocks](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dwm/tree/master/dwmblocks)**
and **[~/.local/bin](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin)**
scripts.

```bash
# dwm & dwmblocks
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dwm.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/dwm
ln -s ~/.config/dwm/autostart.sh ~/.local/share/dwm

# Scripts
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cd ~/.local/bin
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/battery" -o battery
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/volume" -o volume
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/percentage" -o percentage
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/brightness" -o brightness
chmod 755 battery volume percentage brightness

# These scripts have some dependencies
sudo pacman -S pacman-contrib brightnessctl pamixer upower
```

Place this in your **~/.xprofile**:

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Build *dwm* and *dwmblocks* and create a new *xsession*:

```bash
cd ~/.config/dwm
sudo make clean install
cd ~/.config/dwm/dwmblocks
sudo make clean install
sudo cp ~/.config/dwm/dwm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
```

For *autostart*, check **~/.dwm/autostart.sh**.
Test it with **[Xephyr](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xephyr)**:

```bash
Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 1280x720 :1 &
DISPLAY=:1 dwm
```

If you want to modify bar icons, open **~/.config/dwmblocks/config.h**
and change these lines:

```cpp
static const Block blocks[] = {
//   Icon    Command                          Update Interval     Update Signal
    { "ï€™  ", "checkupdates | wc -l",                 60,               0 },
    { "",    "brightness",                           2,                0 },
    { "",    "volume",                               2,                0 },
    { "",    "battery",                              60,               0 },
    { "",    "date '+ï—´ %d/%m/%Y  ï€— %H:%M%p'",        5,                0 },
};
```

Then recompile *dwmblocks* and restart *dwm* using **mod + control + r**.

```bash
cd ~/.config/dwm/dwmblocks
sudo make clean install
```

Once that's done, you can login. But keep in mind keybindings will not work
unless you have the same programs that I use and the same configs. You can
either change keybindings or install the software I use and my config files,
check out [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles#keybindings)
for instructions.
